TODO

* Add functionality to ASA.py to calculate ASA for trajectories as well as Confs -VAV

* Tools to read a Conformation/Trajectory object into OpenMM and build systems.
  Specifically, I want to be able to evaluate conformations using OpenMM energy functions.

* Tools to convert OpenMM System objects to Confs
